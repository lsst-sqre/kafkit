Kafkit
######

Kafkit helps you write Kafka producers and consumers in Python with asyncio:

- Kafkit integrates aiokafka_ consumers and producers with the `Confluent Schema Registry`_.
  The `~kafkit.registry.Deserializer` class can deserialize messages with any schema that's registered in a `Confluent Schema Registry`_.
  The `~kafkit.registry.Serializer` class can serialize Python objects against a single Avro schema, while the `~kafkit.registry.PolySerializer` class is flexible enough to handle multiple schemas.

- Kafkit provides Python APIs for working with the Confluent Schema Registry's HTTP API.
  The `~kafkit.registry.aiohttp.RegistryApi` client includes high-level methods that manage subjects and their schemas in a registry.
  These methods are cached so that the `~kafkit.registry.aiohttp.RegistryApi` client can be an integral part of your application's schema management.
  Additionally, `~kafkit.registry.aiohttp.RegistryApi` includes low-level HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) so you can work directly with the Confluent Schema Registry API if you want.

- `kafkit.registry.aiohttp.RegistryApi` is implemented with aiohttp_, but that's not the only implementation.
  Kafkit subscribes to the `sans IO architecture <https://sans-io.readthedocs.io>`_ (`gidgethub <https://gidgethub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is a popular example) meaning that you can subclass `kafkit.registry.sansio.RegistryApi` to integrate with your favorite HTTP client library.
  The `kafkit.registry.sansio.MockRegistryApi` is a mock client that you can use in your app's unit tests.
